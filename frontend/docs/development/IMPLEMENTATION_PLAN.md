# SConnect Admin Application - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## 📝 TERMINOLOGY GUIDE

**To avoid confusion, this document uses consistent terminology:**

- **🎯 Objectives**: High-level goals listed in this document (Objective 1, 2, 3, etc.)
  - These are strategic areas requiring analysis and planning before implementation
  - Most objectives require breaking down into multiple implementation steps
- **🔧 Steps**: Standard implementation work breakdown for each objective
  - **Step 1: Analysis & Discovery** - Read previous phase docs + examine code to understand specific issues and patterns
  - **Step 2: Design & Planning** - Use previous findings + determine technical approach and create IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
  - **Step 3: Implementation** - Execute planned changes using previous phase identified locations and approaches
  - **Step 4: Testing & Validation** - Verify functionality works correctly and integrates with previous changes
  - **Step 5: Documentation & Tracking** - Create lessons learned doc showing continuity + update IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
  - **Step 6: Git & Deployment Workflow** - Commit, push, and deploy via CI/CD pipeline
  - **Step 7: Quality Assurance Final Check** - Verify completion requirements + phase continuity
- **✅ Subtasks**: Specific actionable items within each step
  - Each step contains multiple subtasks that must be completed
  - Subtasks are the actual work items that can be checked off
  - Example: Step 1 might have subtasks like "Audit error handling patterns", "Catalog parsing violations", etc.

**Summary**: Work on each **Objective** involves multiple **steps** and results in **Phase documentation** when complete.

## 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION TOOLS & REQUIREMENTS

### **📋 MANDATORY PRE-WORK FOR ALL OBJECTIVES**

**Before beginning ANY objective work, you MUST:**

1. **📖 Read Project Knowledge Base**

   - **Requirement**: Read ALL relevant project knowledge documents
   - **Purpose**: Understand existing architecture, patterns, and decisions
   - **Files to Review**: project Readme for context

2. **📚 Read Complete IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

   - **This Document**
   - **Understanding**: Methodology, terminology, success criteria
   - **Context**: How current objective fits into overall IMPLEMENTATION strategy

3. **📚 Read Previous Phase Documentation (CRITICAL FOR CONTINUITY)**

   - **Requirement**: Read ALL completed phase documentation before starting new objective
   - **Purpose**: Build on previous discoveries, avoid duplicating analysis, understand current state
   - **Location**: `/mnt/c/Projects/sconn-admin/frontend/docs/phases/`
   - **Sequential Reading**:
     - For Objective 2: Read Phase 1
     - For Objective 3: Read Phases 1-2 documentation
     - For Objective 4: Read Phases 1-3 documentation
     - And so on...
   - **Extract Key Information**:
     - What specific issues were identified?
     - What files need changes and why?
     - What root causes were discovered?
     - What technical decisions were made?
     - What code locations were identified for changes?

### **⚡ REQUIRED ANALYSIS TOOLS**

**Use Serena MCP Tools for ALL code analysis and updates:**

- **🎯 Project Activation**: **ALWAYS** activate the `sconn-admin` project first:

  ```
  mcp__serena__activate_project: project = "sconn-admin"
  ```

  - **CRITICAL**: Use "sconn-admin" (root project), NOT "backend" or other subprojects
  - This ensures access to correct project memories and context
  - Verify activation shows sconn-admin specific memories and tools

- **🔍 Code Analysis**: Use `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern`, `mcp__serena__find_symbol`, `mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview`
- **📊 Code Understanding**: Use `mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols` to understand dependencies
- **✏️ Code Updates**: Use `mcp__serena__replace_symbol_body`, `mcp__serena__insert_after_symbol`, etc.
- **💾 Knowledge Management**: Use `mcp__serena__write_memory`, `mcp__serena__read_memory` for findings

**Benefits of Using Serena Tools:**

- **Accuracy**: Symbol-level precision prevents errors
- **Efficiency**: Faster than manual file reading and editing
- **Context**: Better understanding of code relationships
- **Consistency**: Standardized approach across all objectives

### **🎯 IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**

**Required Process for Each Objective:**

1. **Knowledge Gathering**: Read project Readme + IMPLEMENTATION PLAN + **ALL previous phase documentation**
2. **Previous Phase Integration**: Extract specific findings, code locations, and technical decisions from prior phases
3. **Tool-Assisted Analysis**: Use Serena MCP tools for code examination (building on previous discoveries)
4. **Systematic Implementation**: Follow 7-step methodology using previous phase insights
5. **Documentation**: Create phase documentation showing how you built on previous work
6. **Quality Assurance**: Verify all completion criteria and continuity with previous phases

**🔗 PHASE CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS:**

- **Before Implementation**: Document what previous phases discovered about your current objective
- **During Implementation**: Reference specific files, line numbers, and issues identified in previous phases
- **After Implementation**: Explain how your changes build on and complete previous phase findings
- **Cross-Reference**: Link your phase documentation to relevant previous phases

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Using proper tools and reading project context is mandatory for successful objective completion. This ensures accuracy, maintains consistency, and leverages established architectural knowledge.

### **🚀 AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS**

**CRITICAL: Agents must complete objectives autonomously without stopping to ask questions.**

**🛭 FIX ALL ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:**

- **Never stop to ask "should I fix this?"** - If you discover issues during your objective work, **FIX THEM**
- **Scope Boundary**: Fix any issues **within your objective scope** - don't hesitate
- **Code Issues**: TypeScript errors, interface mismatches, missing methods, type conflicts - **FIX THEM ALL**
- **Build Issues**: If `npm run build` fails due to your changes, **FIX THE ERRORS** until build passes
- **Integration Issues**: If services don't integrate properly, **FIX THE INTEGRATION**

**❗ DO NOT STOP FOR:**

- TypeScript compilation errors - Fix them
- Missing interface methods - Add them
- Type mismatches - Resolve them
- Build failures - Fix them
- Integration problems - Solve them

### **📚 Phase Completion Documentation Requirements**

## 🔗 **PHASE DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT**

**CRITICAL: Each objective builds directly on previous phase discoveries and must reference prior work.**

### **Phase Dependency Chain**

1. **Phase 1 (Analysis)** → **Phase 2 (Interface Updates)**

   - Phase 2 MUST read Phase 1 findings
   - Phase 2 MUST implement specific interface changes identified in Phase 1
   - Phase 2 MUST reference Phase 1's quantified analysis and root causes

2. **Phases 1-2** → **Phase 3 (ButtonData Interface)**

   - Phase 3 MUST build on Phase 2's interface update patterns
   - Phase 3 MUST resolve specific issues documented in previous phases

3. **Phases 1-3** → **Phase 4 (Service Response Building)**

   - Phase 4 MUST use interfaces updated in Phases 2-3
   - Phase 4 MUST reference specific line numbers and code locations from Phase 1

4. **Continuing Pattern**: Each subsequent phase builds on ALL previous discoveries

### **Mandatory Phase Integration Process**

**For EVERY objective after Phase 1:**

1. **Read ALL previous phase documentation** in `/frontend/docs/phases/`
2. **Extract specific actionable items** identified for your current objective
3. **Document continuity** - show how your work builds on previous phases
4. **Reference previous findings** - use specific file paths, line numbers, issues identified
5. **Validate integration** - ensure your changes work with all previous modifications

### **Phase Documentation Cross-References**

**REQUIRED in every phase document:**

- **"Building on Previous Phases"** section showing what prior work enabled your objective
- **"Specific Previous Findings Applied"** section referencing exact discoveries and locations
- **"Integration Verification"** section confirming compatibility with all previous changes
- **Links to related previous phase documentation**
